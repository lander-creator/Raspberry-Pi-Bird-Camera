# Raspberry-Pi-Bird-Camera

The purpose of the bird box camera is to film the behavior of the birds. This is done with a Raspberry pi, noir camera module and a PIR sensor.
When the PIR sensor detects a bird, the camera starts recording 5 minutes of videos. As long as the bird is there, videos of 5 minutes are recorded. 
The videos are stored on an external storage (USB stick). You can also connect to the bird box WiFi hotspot and play and / or download the videos.
